Most of the time we managed to get a speedup greater than 1 thanks to the CUDA preprocessing. Notice that the theoretical upper bound for the speedup for a given number of processors $P$ is often bigger than $P$. This is not an error because, in the graphs, only the $P$ MPI processes are considered but multiple CUDA threads are implicitly used. More specifically, for this algorithm, the number of CUDA threads is set to be equal to the number of nodes in the input graph.
