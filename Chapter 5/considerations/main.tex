By comparing the obtained speedups with those of the CUDA implementation based on global memory, we conclude that, under most of the test conditions, the speedup was worsened by using the texture memory mechanism. Sometimes the speedup seems to be improved, but the improvement margin is too low to be considered statistically significant.
